# IOS AND XCODE COMPATIBILITY GUIDE

## PURPOSE
THIS DOCUMENT EXPLAINS HOW TO RUN THE FIT WIZARDLY APP IN XCODE / IOS SIMULATOR WITH LIVE RELOAD ("HOT RELOAD").

## FILES CHANGED TO ENABLE THIS
WE MODIFIED OR CREATED THE FOLLOWING FILES TO MAKE THIS WORK:

1.  **`package.json`** (MODIFIED)
    -   ADDED `ios:dev`, `ios:open`, and `ios:sync` SCRIPTS.
    -   THESE SCRIPTS AUTOMATE THE CAPACITOR COMMANDS FOR YOU.

2.  **`capacitor.config.ts`** (MODIFIED)
    -   ADDED `server` CONFIGURATION BLOCK.
    -   THIS TELLS THE APP TO LOAD FROM THE DEV SERVER URI WHEN USING `--live`, INSTEAD OF THE BUNDLED FILES.

3.  **`IOS_XCODE_COMPATIBILITY.md`** (CREATED)
    -   THIS DOCUMENT ITSELF, SERVING AS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR THE WORKFLOW.

## QUICK START: DUAL WORKFLOW

### OPTION A: WEB BROWSER
-   **COMMAND**: `npm run dev`
-   **USE CASE**: FAST UI DEVELOPMENT IN CHROME/SAFARI.

### OPTION B: IOS SIMULATOR ("CODEX" MODE)
-   **COMMAND**: `npm run ios:dev`
-   **USE CASE**: DEVELOPING AND TESTING NATIVE IOS FEATURES.
-   **BEHAVIOR**: OPENS SIMULATOR, LOADS APP, AND **UPDATES INSTANTLY** WHEN YOU SAVE CODE CHANGES.

## DETAILED COMMAND REFERENCE

| SCRIPT | COMMAND | WHAT IT DOES |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `npm run ios:dev` | `npx cap run ios --live --external` | **MAIN WORKFLOW**. BUILDS APP -> SYNCS -> OPENS SIMULATOR -> STARTS LIVE RELOAD. |
| `npm run ios:open` | `npx cap open ios` | OPENS THE FULL XCODE PROJECT. USE FOR NATIVE CONFIG (ICONS, PERMISSIONS). |
| `npm run ios:sync` | `npx cap sync ios` | COPIES `dist/` FOLDER TO NATIVE PROJECT. RUN AFTER INSTALLING NEW PACKAGES. |

## MAC / XCODE SETUP REQUIREMENTS
1.  **MACOS** IS REQUIRED.
2.  **XCODE** MUST BE INSTALLED (MAC APP STORE).
3.  **COCOAPODS** MUST BE INSTALLED: `sudo gem install cocoapods`.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
-   **BUILD FAILED?** RUN `npm run ios:open` AND PRESS "PLAY" IN XCODE TO SEE EXACT ERRORS.
-   **NEW PLUGIN NOT WORKING?** STOP THE DEV SERVER, RUN `npm run ios:sync`, THEN `npm run ios:dev` AGAIN.

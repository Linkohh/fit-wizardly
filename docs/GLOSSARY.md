## Core Concepts
- **Wizard**: The multi-step guided flow (`/wizard`) where users input their specialized fitness data (experience, goals, injuries) to generate a workout plan.
- **Circle**: A social group where users can compete in leaderboards, share feed updates, and join challenges.
- **Plan**: A structured weekly workout routine generated by the Wizard or created manually.

## Fitness Terminology
- **RIR (Reps In Reserve)**: An intensity metric indicating how many more reps could have been performed with good form. (0 RIR = Failure).
- **Split**: The distribution of muscle groups across workout days (e.g., "Push/Pull/Legs", "Upper/Lower").
- **Volume**: Total amount of work performed (usually Sets × Reps × Weight).

## System Terms
- **Onboarding**: The strict initial setup flow for new users (`/onboarding`). Distinct from the "Wizard".
- **Trainer Mode**: A restricted feature set only available to users with `role: 'trainer'` in their profile.
